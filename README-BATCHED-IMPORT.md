# Contentful Batched Migration Guide

This guide explains how to migrate large amounts of content and assets from one Contentful space to another using a batched approach to avoid rate limiting.

## Overview

**Problem:** Direct import of large Contentful exports (4,000+ assets, 11,000+ entries) causes rate limiting errors.

**Solution:** Split the export into manageable batches and import them sequentially with delays between batches.

```

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
2. **Required packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install contentful-import contentful-management
   ```

3. **Contentful Management Token** for target space (EU region)
4. **Exported data** from source space (US region)

## Configuration

Edit `batch-config.json` to match your setup:

```json
{
  "batchSize": 600,                           // Assets per batch (500-700 recommended)
  "sourceFile": "./contentful-export/exported-space.json",
  "sourceAssetsDir": "./contentful-export",
  "outputDir": "./batches",
  "targetSpace": {
    "spaceId": "YOUR_TARGET_SPACE_ID",
    "environmentId": "stage",
    "managementToken": "YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN",
    "host": "api.eu.contentful.com"           // EU region
  },
  "importOptions": {
    "uploadAssets": true,
    "skipContentPublishing": false,
    "delayBetweenBatches": 180000,            // 3 minutes (in milliseconds)
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "retryDelay": 5000
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `batchSize` | Number of assets per batch | 600 |
| `delayBetweenBatches` | Wait time between batches (ms) | 180000 (3 min) |
| `maxRetries` | Number of retry attempts per batch | 3 |
| `retryDelay` | Initial retry delay (ms, exponential backoff) | 5000 |

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Step 1: Split the Export

Split the large export into manageable batches:

```bash
node split-contentful-export.js
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `contentful-export/exported-space.json`
- Analyzes asset-entry relationships
- Splits assets into batches (600 assets each)
- Groups related entries with their assets
- Copies asset files to batch directories
- Generates `batches/manifest.json`

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting Contentful Export Splitter...

📖 Reading source export file...
📊 Source data summary:
  - Content Types: 60
  - Entries: 11985
  - Assets: 4126
  - Tags: 446
  - Locales: 1

🔗 Building asset-entry relationship map...
📦 Splitting into batches of 600 assets...
  - Created 7 batches

📂 Processing Batch 01...
  - Assets: 600
  - Entries: 1250
  ✅ Created: batches/batch-01/exported-space.json
  📁 Copying asset files...
  ✅ Copied 598 asset files

...

✅ Splitting completed successfully!
```

**Result:** Creates `batches/` directory with 7-8 batch subdirectories.

### Step 2: Import Batches

Import all batches sequentially:

```bash
node import-batches.js
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `batches/manifest.json`
- Imports batch 1 (includes content model)
- Imports batches 2-N (data only)
- Waits 3 minutes between batches
- Retries failed batches up to 3 times
- Logs progress to `batches/logs/`
- Saves state to `batches/import-state.json`

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting Contentful Batch Import...

📋 Found 7 batches to import

============================================================
📦 Importing Batch 01 of 7
============================================================

Batch info:
  - Assets: 600
  - Entries: 1250
  - Has content model: Yes
  - Directory: batches/batch-01

[contentful-import output...]

✅ Batch 01 imported successfully!

⏳ Waiting 180 seconds before next batch...

...

📊 Import Summary
Total batches: 7
✅ Successful: 7
❌ Failed: 0

🎉 All batches imported successfully!
```

**Import time estimate:**
- Each batch: 10-15 minutes
- Total: 2-3 hours (including delays)

### Step 3: Validate Migration

Verify all content was migrated successfully:

```bash
node validate-migration.js
```

**What it does:**
- Compares source vs target counts
- Checks content types, entries, assets, tags, locales
- Reports differences and mismatches
- Provides recommendations for issues

**Expected output:**
```

  ❌ Failed: 0
  ⚠️  Warnings: 0

🎉 Validation passed! All data migrated successfully.
```

## Handling Failures

### Resume Failed Import

If the import fails or is interrupted:

```bash
node resume-import.js
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `batches/import-state.json`
- Shows completed and failed batches
- Automatically resumes from the correct batch
- Retries failed batches

**Options:**
- Automatically detects where to resume
- Waits 5 seconds before starting (Ctrl+C to cancel)

### Manual Resume from Specific Batch

```bash
node import-batches.js --start-from 4
```

Starts importing from batch 4 onwards.

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting Errors (429)

**Symptom:** Import fails with rate limit errors

**Solutions:**
1. Increase `delayBetweenBatches` in `batch-config.json` (try 300000 = 5 minutes)
2. Reduce `batchSize` (try 400-500)
3. Wait longer between retry attempts

### Asset Upload Failures

**Symptom:** Some assets fail to upload

**Solutions:**
1. Check `batches/logs/batch-XX-errors.log` for specific errors
2. Verify asset files exist in `contentful-export/` directories
3. Check file permissions
4. Verify asset URLs in export JSON are not empty (see known issues)

### Memory Issues

**Symptom:** Script crashes with "Out of memory" error

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
node --max-old-space-size=4096 split-contentful-export.js
node --max-old-space-size=4096 import-batches.js
```

### Validation Mismatches

**Symptom:** Source and target counts don't match

**Solutions:**
1. Check `batches/import-state.json` for failed batches
2. Review error logs in `batches/logs/`
3. Run `node resume-import.js` to retry failed batches
4. Manually inspect missing items in Contentful UI

## Known Issues

### Empty Asset URLs

Some assets in the export have empty URLs:
```
"assets[933].fields.file.nb-NO.url" is not allowed to be empty
```

**Workaround:** These assets are skipped during import. Manually fix in source space and re-export if needed.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Batch Size

For smaller batches (slower but safer):
```json
{
  "batchSize": 400,
  "delayBetweenBatches": 240000
}
```

### Dry Run (Split Only)

Test the splitting without importing:
```bash
node split-contentful-export.js
# Review batches/ directory
# Don't run import-batches.js yet
```

### Import Specific Batches

Import only batches 3-5:
```bash
# Edit import-batches.js to add batch range logic, or
# Run manually:
cd batches/batch-03
npx contentful-import --config import-config.json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test with a small batch first:** Modify `batchSize` to 100 and test with batch-01
2. **Monitor the first import:** Watch batch-01 import closely for issues
3. **Keep source data:** Don't delete `contentful-export/` until validation passes
4. **Check logs regularly:** Review `batches/logs/` during long imports
5. **Use staging environment:** Test the migration in a staging environment first
6. **Backup target space:** Create a backup before starting large imports

## Cleanup

After successful migration:
```bash
# Optional: Remove batches directory to save space (4.6GB+)
rm -rf batches/

# Keep these for reference:
# - batch-config.json
# - contentful-export/ (original export)
# - manifest.json
# - import-state.json
```
